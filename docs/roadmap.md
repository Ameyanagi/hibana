# Roadmap

## v0.1 — Foundation

- implement a correctness-first scalar matcher with stable scores, matched positions, case policy, path-aware scoring, and bounded top-K selection.
- Define the smallest useful public API and its invariants.
- Add unit, reference-value, and property/invariant coverage.
- Build and test the precompiled package on supported targets.

## v0.2 — Usability

- Add ergonomic APIs only after v0.1 usage demonstrates repeated friction.
- Expand examples and integration fixtures.
- Publish the first modular-community recipe when the package is useful alone.

## v0.3 — Performance

- Add reproducible benchmarks and representative datasets.
- Optimize measured bottlenecks without weakening correctness or API clarity.
- Add SIMD or specialized backends only behind the same semantic contract.

## v1.0 — Stability

- Document every public symbol and error contract.
- Provide a compatibility and deprecation policy.
- Support the declared OS and architecture matrix in CI.
- Require downstream proof from at least one independent consumer.

## Not planned

Japanese, pinyin, Hangul, terminal UI, filesystem traversal, and CJK phonetic generation are outside this package.
